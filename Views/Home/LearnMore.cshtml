                        With a team that brings HR and Data expertise from 3K+ organizational hires and 30K+ job seeker interviews, we understand how to find the best matches for the role.
                        Our focus is on Small-medium sized (SMB) organizations (< 500 employees) and developer/programmer/IT roles (we will grow into many more roles as we continue to grow).

                        Our goal is to provide a better Job Seeker experience and that you never have to look for a job again, and a better organizational experience by reducing time and cost to recruit by providing well matched candidates quickly.
